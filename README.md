# MPhys-Project
My MPhys project exploring extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics. This project involves deep learning with large datasets from the LHC.

Headline result so far: over a year of processing by the LHC computing cluster, my CLs predicting model could save over a month of processing time wasted on invalid (CLs < 0.05) models.

# Targets
- [x] Create model that predicts DM relic density better than random sampling of target range
- [x] Reduce MAE to below 25% of mean absolute target error
- [ ] Completely eliminate mode collapse
- [x] Create plot of MAE in bins of true relic density
- [x] Plot upper cutoff of relic density against number of valid but excluded pMSSM models
- [ ] Apply EWKino model to Bino-DM and evaluate performance
- [x] Apply same relic density cutoff technique to CLs. Very successful!
- [ ] Work out similarities between models incorrectly rejected by CLs prediction
